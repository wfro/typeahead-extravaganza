# React Crash Course!

## Intro

Sup! Welcome to a quick workshop where the ultimate goal is implement a typeahead (think the Google search bar) in React. But, we'll get there by first doing the same thing with plain old JavaScript. The goal here is to learn React, but we're taking this approach for a few reasons:
* It's good to get a sense for what it means to build UIs regardless of framework or technology. We want to train ourselves as React developers, but we also want to train ourselves as problem solvers. 
* React was invented to make our lives easier as developers. To help us move faster, to help us not want to lightly bang our heads against the desk when we think about our code. What better way to explore this than to see both sides of the fence? 

Most of the time when I do workshops like these I lose sight of the underlying ideas in the midst of trying to get things to work, so the next few sections are partially for posterity. Take a look now to get the wheels moving and such, but this  should also be useful to check back in on later. 

### Goals
* strong understanding of the DOM and how to interact with it (creating and appending elements, reading data, etc]
* a sense of what "state" is, regardless of the technology used to implement a feature]
* react fundamentals
   * props, state
   * setState and state management
   * component driven design
   * one-way data flow, top-down rendering
   * imperative vs. declarative, react takes care of DOM
   * benefits of full re-render on every state change
 * More generally, see the steps of a generalized problem-solving process

## Vanilla JavaScript, mmmmmmmmmm

For both iterations (plain JS and React) we'll follow this general problem-solving process:

* Get a feel for requirements
* Break down the probably into managemable, actionable steps
* Make the thing
